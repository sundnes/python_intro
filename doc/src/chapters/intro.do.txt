This book teaches the Python programming language, which is
one of the most popular languages for introductory programming courses.
An advantage of Python is that it is a so-called high-level language,
with simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to get started. However,
although it works well as a beginner's language, Python is also
suitable for more advanced tasks, and it is currently one of the most widely used
programming languages worldwide.

======= The first example: Hello, World! =======
idx{editor} idx{terminal} idx{IDE} idx{`print`}
Most introductory books on programming start with a so-called Hello, World! program,
which is a program that simply writes  *Hello, World!* to the screen. In
Python, this program is just a single line;
!bc pycod
print("Hello, World!")
!ec
To actually write and run such a program, Python offers a number of different options.
Throughout this book we will mostly apply the classical programming approach,
where a program is written in a text editor and stored as a file that is then
run from the command line window or an integrated development environment (IDE).
To write and run the "Hello, World!"-program above, open your favorite
editor (Atom, gedit, Emacs etc.), type the given line and save the file
with a suitable filename, for instance, `hello.py`.[^Install] Then, open a terminal or
an iPython window, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type
`python hello.py`, if you are using a regular terminal, or `run hello.py` if you
are using iPython. The output *Hello, World!* should appear in the terminal right after the command.
If you are using an IDE, it is essentially an editor and an iPython/terminal
window combined. For instance, in the popular Spyder IDE the editor is usually
in the upper left window, while the window in the lower right corner is the
iPython window where you run the program. [^Spyder]

[^Install]: We do not describe the technical details of acquiring and installing
Python here, since this information is platform dependent and becomes
outdated very quickly. For updated hints on installing Python, see
the web page for the IN1900 course at the University of Oslo
(`https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN1900/index-eng.html`), or to the
numerous other resources found online.

[^Spyder]: For details, see, for instance, `https://www.spyder-ide.org/`.

Although the "Hello, World!"-program could seem like a silly example, it
serves a number of useful purposes. First of all,
running this small program will verify that you have installed Python properly,
and that you have installed the right version. It also introduces the
function `print`, which will be used virtually every time we program, and
it illustrates how we use quotes to define a `string` in Python. While `print` is
a word that Python understands, *hello* and *world* are not. By using the
quotes, we tell Python that it should not try to understand (or interprete)
these words, but, rather, treat them as simple text that, in this case, is to be
printed to the screen. We will come back to this topic in more detail later.

======= Different ways to use Python =======
idx{ipython} idx{Jupyter notebooks} idx{versions (Python)}
As briefly mentioned above, Python offers some alternatives to the traditional style
of programming using a text editor and a terminal window, and some of these
alternatives can be very useful when learning to program. For instance, we can
use Python interactively by simply typing `python` or `ipython` in a terminal window,
without a subsequent file name. This will open an environment for typing and
running Python commands, which is not very
suitable for writing programs over several lines, but extremely useful for
testing Python commands and statements, or simply using Python as a calculator.
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
In a regular terminal window on macOS or Linux, an interactive version
of the Hello, World! example would look something like
!bc sys
Terminal> ipython
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 16:54:48)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 7.4.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!

In [2]:
!ec
The two versions `python` and `ipython` work largely the same way, but
`ipython` has a number of additional features and is recommended.
# #endif

A third way to use Python is through *Jupyter notebooks*, which
are a form of interactive notebooks that combine code and text. The notebooks are
viewed through a browser and look quite similar to a simple web page, but with the
important difference that the code segments are "live" Python code that can
be run, changed, and re-run while reading the document. These features are
particularly useful for teaching purposes, since detailed explanations of new
concepts are easily combined with interactive examples. All the chapters of this book
are also available as Jupyter notebooks.

=== Minor drawbacks of the Python language. ===
Although Python is a very popular and suitable language for learning to program,
it also has some minor drawbacks. One of the more important is tightly
linked to its advantage of being a flexible high-level language with
a short and intuitive syntax. Writing small programs in Python
can be very efficient, and beginners can quickly start writing useful
programs, but the downside is that the code can become messy as the
programs grow in size and complexity.
Other languages such as C, C++, and Java tend, to enforce more structure in the code,
which can be confusing for beginners and annoying when you want to write a
small program quickly, but it can
be more efficient in the long run when writing larger programs. However, it is
certainly possible to write neat and nicely structured programs in Python as
well, but this requires a choice by the programmer to follow certain
principles of coding style, and is not enforced by the language itself.

Another slightly annoying aspect of Python is that it exists in different
versions. At the time of this writing, Python 3 has been dominant
for quite a while, but if you look for programming resources online or read
older textbooks, you will find many examples using Python 2. For the
mathematics-centered programming covered in this book, the difference between
Python 2 and Python 3 is actually quite small, but some differences are important
to be aware of. The most obvious one is how `print` works. In Python 2, the
program above would read `print "Hello, World!"`, that is, without
the parentheses. Since nearly all code examples use `print` to some extent, programs
written in Python 2 will typically not run in Python 3. One particularly
relevant resource for scientific Python (on which this book is largely based)
is "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python", by
Hans Petter Langtangen[^primer2]. However, the latest
version of that book was written in 2016, and all the code examples are
in Python 2 and will stop with an error message if they are run in Python 3.
In most cases, the only error is the missing parentheses;
so the addition of parentheses to all the print statements will make most of
the examples run fine in Python 3. We will comment on
some of the other differences between the Python versions later.
