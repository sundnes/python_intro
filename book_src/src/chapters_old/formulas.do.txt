# TITLE: Ch.1: Programming with formulas
# AUTHOR: Joakim Sundnes at Simula Research Laboratory & University of Oslo, Dept. of Informatics
# DATE: today

In this chapter we will take one step beyond the "Hello world!"-example of
the previous chapter, and introduce programming with mathematical formulas.
Such formulas are essential parts of most programs written for scientific
applications, and they are also useful for introducing the concept of
*variables*, which is a fundamental part of all programming languages.
After working through the examples of this chapter you will:
 * Know what *variables* are, and how they are used in programs
 * Know how to program mathematical expressions in Python
 * Know about *types*, and how you can check the type of a variable
 * Be able to use *comments* to make your programs more readable

To introduce these concepts, consider first a simple formula
for calculating interest on a bank deposit:
!bt
\[
A = P(1+(r/100))^n .
\]
!et
Here $P$ is the initial deposit (the *principal*), $r$ is the yearly interest
rate given in percent, $n$ is the number of years, and $A$ is the final amount.



, the amount $A$ after $ndeposit an
amount $P$ at an interest rate $r$, the Assuming that
formula from high school physics, describing the height of a ball in vertical motion
!bt
\[ y(t) = v_0t- \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \]
!et
where
  * $y$ is the height (position) as function of time $t$
  * $v_0$ is the initial velocity at $t=0$
  * $g$ is the acceleration of gravity

The task is now to write a program that computes $y$ for given values of $v_0$, $g$ and $t$. We could of course easily do
this with a calculator, but a small program is much more flexible and powerful. To evaluate the formula above,
we first need to assign some values to $v_0$, $g$ and $t$, and then make the calculation. Choosing for instance
$t=0.6, g = 9.81$, and $v_0=5$, a complete Python program for evaluating the formula above reads
!bc pypro
print(5*0.6 - 0.5*9.81*0.6**2)
!ec
As for the example above, this line can be typed into an interactive Python session, or written in an editor and stored in a file, for instance
`ball1.py`. Then, the program is run with `python ball1.py` in a regular terminal, or `run ball1.py` in an iPython window or  Spyder.

The `ball1.py`-program is not much more complex, or more useful, than the "Hello world!"-example above, but notice that in this case
we did not use quotation marks inside the parantheses. The reason is that we actually want Python to evaluate the formula,
and print the result to the screen, which works fine as long as the text inside the paranthesis is valid Python code. If we
put quotation marks around the formula above, the code would still work, but the result is not what we want (try it!).
At this point it is also worth noting that while Python may be a "flexible" and "high-level" language, as described above,
all programming languages are extremely pick about spelling and grammar. Consider for instance the line
!bc
write(5*0,6 - 0,5*9,81*0,6^2)
!ec
While most people may read this line quite easily, and interpret it as the physics formula above, it makes no sense
as a Python program. There are multiple errors: `write` is not a legal Python word in this context, comma has another
meaning than in math, and the hat does not mean exponentiation. We have to be extremely accurate with how we write
computer programs, and it takes time and experience to learn this.

## stupid they are.* G. J. E. Rawlins
## !equote

The evaluation of the mathematical formula above is performed according to the standard rules. The terms are evaluated one by
one, starting from left, exponentiation is performed first and then multiplication and division. If we want to control the
order of evaluation, we can use parantheses, just as we would do in mathematics. For instance these two lines here will
provide quite different results:
!bc pypro
print(2 + 2*3)
print((2 + 2)*3)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
8
12
!ec
# #endif
The use of parantheses to group calculations works exactly as in mathematics, and is not very difficult to understand for people with
a mathematical background. However, when programming more complicated formulas it is very easy to make mistakes such as forgetting or misplacing
a closing paranthesis. This mistake is probably the most common source of error when programming mathematical formulas, and even for
experienced programmers it is worth paying close attention to the order and number of parantheses in the expressions. Getting it wrong will
either lead to an error message when the code is run or to a program that runs
fine but gives an unexpected results. The first type of error is usually quite easy to find and to fix, but the latter may be much harder.

Although Python is quite strict on the spelling and grammar, or *syntax*, of the formulas, there is some flexibility. For instance,
whitespace, or blanks, inside a formula does not matter at all. An expression like `5    *2` works just as well as `5*2`. In general, whitespace
in a Python program only matters if it is at the start of a line, which we will come back to later. Otherwise, one should use whitespace
in order to make the code as readable as possible to humans, since Python will ignore it anyway.


======= Variables =======

In mathematics we are used to variables, such as $v_0$, $g$ and $t$ in the formula above. We can use variables in a
program to, which makes the program easier to read and understand:
!bc pycod
v0 = 5
g = 9.81
t = 0.6
y = v0*t - 0.5*g*t**2
print(y)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
1.2342
!ec
# #endif
This program spans several lines of text and uses variables, but otherwise performs the same calculations
and gives the same output as the one-line program above. Even for this very simple example the use of
variables has a few advantages, mainly that the program becomes easier to read, the physics formula
is much more recognizable, and changing the value of a given variable is easier. The latter point is true in
particular for the variable `t`, which occurs twice in the formula. To evaluate the formula at a new time point,
we now only need to assign a new value to the variable in one place, while the one-line version of the program has to be
changed in two places. The latter is very error prone, since it is easy to forget one of the places that needs to be changed,
and should always be avoided. If the same number occurs more than once in a program, you should always use a
variable to store it.

The instructions in the program are called *statements*, and are executed one by one when we run the program.
It is common to have one statement per line, although it is possible to put muleiple statements on one line,
separated by semicolon, as in `v0 = 5; g = 9.81; t = 0.6`.
For people new to programming, especially those
used to reading mathematics, it is worth taking note of
the strict sequence in which the lines are executed. In the mathematical equation above we first introduced a formula with
some variables ($v_0, g, t$), and then defined these variables further down. This approach is completely standard
in mathematics, but it makes no sense in programming. Programs are executed line by line from the top, so all definitions of
variables must be done *above* the line where they are used.

Choosing variable names is up to the programmer, and in general there is great flexibility in choosing such names.
In mathematics it is common to use a single letter for a variable, but a variable in Python program can be any
word containing the letters a-z, A-Z, underscore `_` and the digits 0-9, but it cannot start with a digit. Variable names
Python are also case-sensitive, for instance `a` is different from `A`. The following program is identical to the
one above, but with different variable names:
!bc pypro
initial_velocity = 5
accel_of_gravity = 9.81
TIME = 0.6
VerticalPositionOfBall = initial_velocity*TIME - \
                         0.5*accel_of_gravity*TIME**2
print(VerticalPositionOfBall)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
1.2342
!ec
# #endif
Note that the backslash allows an expression to be continued on the next line. These alternative names are arguably
more descriptive, but also makes the formula very long and cumbersome to read. Choosing good variable names is often a
balance of being descriptive and being short and compact, and can be quite important for making a program easy to
read and understand. Writing readable and understandable code also makes it easier to find errors in the code, so
choosing good variable names is worthwhile even if you are the only person who will ever read your code. Although the
choice of variable names is up to the programmer, some names are reserved in Python and are not allowed to be used. These are `and`,
`as`,
`assert`,
`break`,
`class`,
`continue`,
`def`,
`del`,
`elif`,
`else`,
`except`,
`exec`,
`finally`,
`for`,
`from`,
`global`,
`if`,
`import`,
`in`,
`is`,
`lambda`,
`not`,
`or`,
`pass`,
`print`,
`raise`,
`return`,
`try`,
`with`,
`while`, and
`yield`.
This list is difficult to memorize at this point, but we will use many of these words in our programs later so it will be
quite natural that they cannot be used as variable names. However, it may be worth taking note of `lambda`, since the Greek
letter $\lambda$ is commonly used in mathematical formulas. Since
Python does not understand Greek letters it is common to just spell them out when programming a formula, i.e. $\alpha$ becomes `alpha` etc.,
but for $\lambda$ we will need to introduce a small intentional typo and write `lmbda` or similar.

The program above contains two different types of statements; several assignment statements, which assign values to variables,
followed by a single print statement at the end. It may be quite intuitive how these statements work, but the assignment statements
are worth looking into in more detail. In these statements, the right hand side of the equality sign is evaluated first, and then
the result is assigned to the variable on the left. An effect of this execution order is that statements like the following work just
fine, and are common to see in programs:
!bc pycod
t = 0.6
t = t + 0.1
print(t)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
0.7
!ec
# #endif
The second line of this code does not make sense as a mathematical equation, but is a perfectly valid assignment in a computer
program. The right hand side is
evaluated first, using the value of `t` already defined, and then `t` is updated to the result of the calculation. The
equality sign in Python is called the *assignment operator*, and it works almost like an equality sign in mathematics, but not quite.
If, for instance, we want to compare two numbers to figure out if they are equal, the operator to use in Python is `==`. For instance,
a trivial comparison may look like
!bc pycod
a = 5
print(a == 5)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
True
!ec
# #endif
We will see many more such examples later.

=== Comments are useful to explain how you think in programs. ===
We may combine the strengths of the two programs above, and have both compact variable names *and* a
more detailed description of what they are. This can be done using *comments*, as illustrated in the
following example:
!bc pycod
# program for computing the height of a ball
# in vertical motion
v0 = 5    # initial velocity
g = 9.81  # acceleration of gravity
t = 0.6   # time
y = v0*t - 0.5*g*t**2  # vertical position
print(y)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
1.2342
!ec
# #endif
In this code all the text following the `#` symbol is treated as a comment, and effectively ignored by Python.
Comments are used to explain what the computer instructions mean, what variables mean, how the
programmer reasoned when the program was written, etc. Comments can be very useful for increasing readability,
although they should not be over-used. Comments that say no more than the code, for instance `a = 5  # set a to 5`,
are not very useful.

======= Variable *types* =======

So far all the variables we have used have been numbers, which is also what we are used to from mathematics. However, in
a computer program we can have many different kinds of variables, not just numbers. All variables have a *type*, which is
usually decided automatically based on the value we assign to it. For instance, the statement `v0 = 5` will create
a variable of the type *integer*, or `int`, while for instance `t = 0.6` will create a variable of type `float`, representing
a floating point number. We can also have text variables, called strings in Python, having type `str`,
for string. For instance, the "Hello world!"-example above could have been written as
!bc pycod
hello = "Hello world!"
print(hello)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
Hello world!
!ec
# #endif
We will encounter many more variable types in subsequent chapters. The type of a variable
decides how it can be used, and also the effect of various operations. These rules are usually
quite intuitive. For instance, most mathematical operations only work with variable types that actually represent numbers,
or they have a different effect on other variable types, when this is natural.
To get an idea of how this works in Python, think about some simple mathematical operations on strings. Which of the following operations
do you think are allowed, and what are the results? (i) Adding two strings together, (ii) multiplying a string with an integer,
(iii) multiplying two strings, and (iv) multiplying a string with a decimal number. Then try it in Python:
!bc pycod
print(hello + hello)
print(hello*5)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
hellohello
hellohellohellohellohello
!ec
# #endif
Strings that contain numbers are a potential source of confusion. Consider for instance the code
!bc pycod
x1 = 2
x2 = "2"
print(x1+x1)
print(x2+x2)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
4
22
!ec
# #endif
We see that the `x2` variable is still treated as a text string in Python, because it was defined using the
quotation marks, even though it contains a single number. Sometimes it may be useful to check the type of a variable,
and this is easy to do with the function `type`:
!bc pycod
print(type(hello))
print(type(t))
print(type(v0))
print(type(2))
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
<class 'str'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'int'>
<class 'int'>
!ec
# #endif
We see that the output is as we would expect from how the variables were defined above. The word `class` preceding the types
indicates that these types are defined as *classes* in Python, a concept we will get back to later. Checking the type of a variable is
often very useful if you get unexpected behaviors from your program. Usually we can let Python select the type
automatically and not pay mutch attention to it, but in some cases it can be useful to convert between variable types.
For the examples in this book, by far the most common type conversion is to convert text containing a number to an
actual decimal number, which is done with the funtion `float`. The same function can be used to convert an integer to a decimal number.
!bc pycod
x1 = float(x1)
x2 = float(x2)
print(type(x1))
print(type(x2))
print(x2+x2)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
<class 'float'>
<class 'float'>
4.0
!ec
# #endif
Of course, using `float` to convert a string to a number requires that the string is actually a number. Trying to convert
a regular work, as in `float(hello)` will make the program stop with an error message.

======= Formatting text output =======

The calculations in the programs above would output a single number, and simply print this number to the screen.
In many cases this solution is fine, but sometimes we want
several numbers or other types of output from a program. This is easy to do with the `print` function, by simply
putting several variables inside the parantheses, separated by comma. For instance, if we want to output both
`t` and `y` from the calculation above, the following line would fork:
!bc pycod
print(t,y)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
0.6 1.2342
!ec
# #endif
However, although this line works, it is not necessarily the most readable or useful output. Sometimes it is useful to
format the output better, and to use a combination of text and numbers, for instance
!bc dat
At t=0.6 s, y is 1.23 m.
!ec
There are multiple ways to accomplish this in Python, but the most recent and arguably most convenient is to use so
called *f-strings*, which were introduced in Python 3.6. If you are using an earlier version of Python the following examples
will therefore not work, but there are alternative ways of formatting text that will be described later in these notes.

To achieve the output string above, using the *f-string* formatting, we would replace the final line with
!bc pycod
print(f"At t={t} s, y is {y} m.")
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
At t=0.6 s, y is 1.2342 m.
!ec
# #endif
There are three things worth noticing here. First, we enclose the output in quotation marks, just as in the
"Hello world!"-example above, which tells Python that this is a string. Second the string is prefixed with the letter `f`,
which indicates that the string may contain something extra. More specifically, the string may contain
expressions or variables enclosed in curly braces. Third, we have included two such variables, `t` and `y`, enclosed in curly
braces. When Python encounters these braces inside an f-string, it will evaluate the contents of the braces, which may be an
expression or a variable, and insert the resulting value into the string. In this case it will simply insert the
current values of the variables `t` and `y`. If we want, we could also include a mathematical expression inside the
braces, such as
!bc pycod
print(f"2+2 = {2+2}")
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
2+2 = 4
!ec
# #endif
The only requirement for the contents inside the braces is that it must be a valid Python expression, which can be
evaluated to give some kind of value. In these notes we will typically use it for numbers, but it may also be used
for variables with other types of values.

The f-string formatting will ususally give nicely formatted output by default, but sometimes we want more detailed control
of the formatting. For instance, we may want to control the number of decimals when outputting numbers. This is conveniently obtained
by including a *format specifier* inside the curly braces. Consider for instance the following code:
!bc pycod
t = 1.234567
print(f"Default output gives t = {t}.")
print(f"We can set the precision: t = {t:.2}.")
print(f"Or control the number of decimals: t = {t:.2f}.")
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
Default output gives t = 1.234567.
We can set the precision: t = 1.2.
Or control the number of decimals: t = 1.23.
!ec
# #endif
There are many different format specifiers, for controlling the output format of both numbers and other types of variables. We will
only use a small subset in this course, and primarily to output numbers. In addition to thoseshown above, the following
may be useful;
!bc pycod
print(f"Or control the space used for the output: t = {t:8.2f}.")
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
Or control the space used for the output: t =     1.23
!ec
# #endif
This is used to control the number of decimals in a number, and also how much space (the number of characters) used to output the number
on the screen. Here we have specified the number to be output with two decimals and a total length of eight, including the decimals.
This form of control is very useful for outputting multiple lines in a table-like format, to ensure that the columns in the table are
properly aligned. A similar feature can be used for integers
!bc pycod
r = 87
print(f"Integer output specified to take up 8 chars of space: r = {r:8d}")
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
Integer output specified to take up 8 chars of space: r =       87
!ec
# #endif
Finally, the generic format specifier `g` will output a floating point number in the most compact form, consider for instance:
!bc pycod
a = 786345687.12
b = 1.2345
print(f"Without the format specifier: a = {a}, b = {b}.")
print(f"With the format specifier: a = {a:g}, b = {b:g}.")
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
Without the format specifier: a = 786345687.12, b = 1.2345.
With the format specifier: a = 7.86346e+08, b = 1.2345.
!ec
# #endif

======= Importing modules =======
We have seen that standard arithmetic operations are directly available in Python, without any
extra effort. However, what if need more advanced operations such as $\sin x$, $\cos x$, $\ln x$, etc.?
These functions are not available directly, but can be found in a so-called *module*,
which must be imported before we can use them in our program. In general, lots of functionality in Python
is found in such modules, and we will import a few modules in nearly all programs we write. The standard
mathematical functions are found in the `math` module. For instance, the following code computes
the square root of a number, using the `sqrt` function in the `math` module:
!bc pycod
import math
r = math.sqrt(2)
# or
from math import sqrt
r = sqrt(2)
# or
from math import *   # import everything in math
r = sqrt(2)
!ec
These examples illustrate three different ways of important modules. In the first one, we import
everything from the `math` module, but everything we want to use must be prefixed with `math`. The
second option involves only the `sqrt` function, and it imports it into the main *namespace* of the
program, which means it can be used with no prefix. Finally, the third option imports everything
from `math` into the main namespace, so all functions from the module are available in our program
without the prefix.

A natural question to ask is why we need three different ways to import a module. Why not use the
simple `from math import *` and get access to all the mathematics functions we need? The reason is
that we will often import from several modules, and some of these modules contain functions with
identical names. In such cases it is useful to have some control over which functions we actually
use, either by selecting only what we need from each module, as in `from math import srt`, or
by importing as in `import math` so that all functions must be prefixed with the module name.
To avoid confusion later it may be good to get into the habit of importing modules like this right away,
although in small programs where we only import a single module there is nothing wrong with `from math import *`.

Another natural question at this point is how we know where to find the functions we want. For instance,
say we need to compute with complex numbers. How can we know if there is a module in Python for this? And
if there is, what is it called? In general, learning about the useful modules and what they contain are part
of learning to program, but it may be even more important to know where to find such information. An excellent source
is the Python Library Reference (https://docs.python.org/3/library/), which contains information about all the standard module
that are distributed with Python. More generally, a google search such as `complex numbers python` quickly leads us
to the `cmath` module, which contains mostly the same functions as `math`, but with support for complex numbers.
To check the contents of a module, one may also use the command `pydoc` in the terminal window, for instance `pydoc math`,
or we can import the module in a Python program and list its contents with the builtin function `dir`.
!bc pycod
import math
print(dir(math))
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
['__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', (...) ]
!ec
# #endif

As another example of computing with functions from `math` consider the task of evaluating
!bt
\[ Q = \sin x\cos x + 4\ln x, \mbox{ for } x = 1.2. \]
!et
The Python code looks as follows:
!bc pypro
from math import sin, cos, log
x = 1.2
Q = sin(x)*cos(x) + 4*log(x)   # log is ln (base e)
!ec
Note that the $\ln$ function is called `log` in the `math` module, while the logarithm with base 10 is called `log10`'

!split
======= Pitfalls when programming mathematics =======

Usually, the mathematical operations as described above work as we would expect. When the results are not what we expect, the
cause is usually a trivial error we have introduced while typing, typically assigning the wrong value to a variable or (most common)
messing up the number of parantheses. However, some potential error sources are less obvious, and are worth knowing about even if they are
relatively rare.

=== Round-off errors give inexact results. ===
Computers have inexact arithmetics because of rounding errors. This is usually not a problem in
computations, but in some cases it
may cause unexpected results. Let us for instance compute $1/49\cdot 49$ and $1/51\cdot 51$:
!bc pycod
v1 = 1/49.0*49
v2 = 1/51.0*51
print(f"{v1:.16f} {v2:.16f}")
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
Output with 16 decimals becomes
!bc dat
 0.9999999999999999 1.0000000000000000
!ec
# #endif
Most real numbers are represented inexactly on a computer, typically with 17 digits accuracy.
Neither 1/49 nor 1/51 are represented exactly, and the error is approximately $10^{-16}$. Errors of this order usually don't
matter, but there are two particular cases where they may be significant. One is that in some cases they may accumulate
through numerous computations and end up as a significant error in the final result. The other, which you are more likely to
encounter through this course, is that comparison of two decimal numbers may be unpredictable. The two numbers
`v1` and `v2` above are both supposed to be equal to 1, but look at the result of this code:
!bc pycod
print(v1 == 1)
print(v2 == 1)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
False
True
!ec
# #endif
We see that the evaluation works as expected in one case but not the other, and this is a general problem when comparing floating
point numbers. In most cases it works, but in some cases it doesn't. It is difficult or impossible to predict when it will not
work, and the behavior of the program therefore becomes unpredictable. The solution is to always compare floats using a tolerance,
as in
!bc pycod
tol = 1e-14
print(abs(v1-1) < tol)
print(abs(v2-1) < tol)
!ec
# #if FORMAT != 'ipynb'
!bc dat
True
True
!ec
# #endif
There is no strict rule for how to set the value of the tolerance `tol`, but it should be small number, but larger than the
typical machine precision $10^{-16}$.

=== Integer division may cause surprising errors. ===
In Python 2, and many other programming languages, unintended *integer division* may sometimes cause surprising
results. In Python 3 this is no longer a problem, so you are not likely to run into it during this course, but
it is worth being aware of the problem since many other programming languages behave in this way. Recall from above that
various operations behave differently depending on the type of the variable they work on, for instance adding two strings
vs adding numbers. In Python 2, the division operator, $/$, behaves like normal division if one of the two arguments
are floats, but if both are integers then it will perform integer division, and discard the decimal part of the result.
Consider the following interactive session, which runs Python 2.7:
!bc
Terminal> python2.7
Python 2.7.14 (default, Sep 22 2017, 00:06:07)
(...)
>>> print(1.0/2)   #the parantheses are optional in Python 2.7
0.5
>>> print(1/2)
0
!ec


Integer division is useful for many tasks in computer science, and is therefore the default behavior of many
programming languages, but it is usually not what want when programming mathematical formulas. Therefore, it may be
a good habit to ensure that variables used in calculations are actually floats, by simply defining them as `v0 = 5.0` rather
than `v0 = 5`. Although it does not really make a difference in Python 3, it is good to get into this habit simply to avoid
problems when programming in other languages later.
